=============
This is the code of my personal webpage. It is deployed in Redhat Openshift, and this github repository is synced with the most recent version.

It is a Java Web project that uses JSF 2.2 and Primefaces. However, most of the code is just pure HTML, CSS and Javascript (with some libs like jQuery, fullContent and Masonry).

My personal website is accessible in <a href="http://machadolucas.me">http://machadolucas.me</a>.
