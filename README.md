#home
=============

## Attention: This project is now deprecated, since I did the migration to SpringBoot and Thymeleaf. You can check my new repository, "home2".

This is the code of my personal webpage. It is deployed in Redhat Openshift, and this github repository is synced with the most recent version.

It is a Java Web project that uses JSF 2.2 and Primefaces. However, the code is basically just pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.

My personal website is accessible in <a href="http://machadolucas.me">http://machadolucas.me</a>.
